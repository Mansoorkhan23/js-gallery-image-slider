# js-gallery-image-slider

The "js-gallery-image-slider" is my first JavaScript project that creates a simple image slider with left and right buttons. By clicking on the respective button, the slider moves to the next or previous image in the sequence. This project is built using basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and can be easily customized to fit different website designs. It's a great tool for adding dynamic visual elements to your website.
